# MLND-Capstone.
## My capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.
#### In this project, I use a deep learning-based approach to improve gender classification detection. My final model uses a fully convolutional neural network to output an image of a Man or woman. gender classification and detection using: IMDB datasets with a keras CNN model and openCV.
* IMDB gender classification test accuracy: 96%.
